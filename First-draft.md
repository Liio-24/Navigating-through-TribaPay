>Unique Features

- CashPins:
This is one of Tribapay's unique features. It's the first of it's kind. A cashpin is a 16-digit pin that can be used to save cash within your wallet, send cash/airtime to people (who must be Tribapay users) and receive cash/airtime, either by the user who created the cash pin, or by a third party account. 

How do you generate a cashpin?
1. You must be a registered Tribapay user.
2. Fund your wallet.
3. Click on cashpin and select the create cashpin option.
4. Enter the amount of money you want to convert to a cashpin and the units of pins. 

It's as easy as it sounds. You can generate cashpins worth different amounts of money and send it to different people. This would really be a good giveaway tool. 

You can redeem the cashpin you create as cash/airtime, send it to someone who can redeem it as cash/airtime also. 

Other things to note about cashpins is that, they don't expire, and you can't withdraw it; it can only be redeemed by another Tribapay user as cash/airtime.

- Airtime to Cash

This is another amazing feature that Tribapay has; the Airtime to cash feature. You and I have obviously been victims of overcharging our accounts for airtime. Tribapay offers this feature that makes it possible for you to sell your airtime and get cash. They take a 20% interest for all networks.
